# Excel_UCL
Excel Data analysis projects done in the Catholic University of Lille.

In the "Advanced Use of Spreadsheets" course at the Catholic University of Lille, I engaged in data-driven projects focused on preforming many analysis. Leveraging my expertise in spreadsheet tools and techniques, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of a dataset aimed at uncovering valuable insights into consumer preferences, purchasing patterns, and market dynamics.
